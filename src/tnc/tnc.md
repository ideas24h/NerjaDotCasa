9.- Responsibilities attributable to "NERJA.CASA".

If the reserved property presents serious deficiencies that prevent its normal use, "NERJA.CASA" commits itself to look for an alternative solution of similar characteristics and price. If this is not feasible due to a lack of available accommodation(s) or because "The Client" rejects the proposals offered, "NERJA.CASA" will reimburse all or part of the amount of the reservation, depending on the time the client has enjoyed the accommodation, without any additional responsibility being attributed to "NERJA.CASA".

"NERJA.CASA" will not assume any responsibility in the following cases:

d) Damage to persons or things caused by force majeure or unforeseen mishaps for which "NERJA.CASA" or its representatives cannot be held responsible.
e) Due to more or less difficult access to the rented properties (country lanes, unpaved roads, lack of public transport, etc.), the client must check the exhaustive description in the information sheet of the property.

Consequently, the responsibility of "NERJA.CASA" is limited to its intermediation function, according to the scope that it has and is effectively developed by it, not assuming any of the responsibilities that legally correspond to the property regarding the seasonal renting of properties. In any case, "The Client" accepts that the economic responsibility of "NERJA.CASA" for eventual damages, material or otherwise, that could be caused as a consequence of its intermediation, will always and in any case be limited to the total amount paid for the rent.
